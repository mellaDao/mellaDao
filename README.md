- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mellaDao (She/her)
- ðŸŒ± I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Computer Science.
- I'm working on a personal project of mine where I'm developing a website for generating knitting patterns which I've called YarnForge.
- I'm hoping to eventually be a full stack web developer!
  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm not just a coder; I'm also a dedicated fiber artist! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
- I love working with various fibers and textiles to blend traditional craftsmanship and a touch of modern creativity.
